
This function was written in MATLAB R2020. To run the multiscale analysis, you need to download and save the additional functions: `Ra_v2`, `Roug`, and `saveTiffFloat`. Save these files in the same directory as this script.

Run the main function "process_reef_rugosity.m".

Example of usage:
```matlab
process_reef_rugosity(input_path, output_path);
```

Where:
- `input_path` - Path to the directory containing reef DEM (Digital Elevation Model) files.
- `output_path` - Path where you want to save the rugosity analysis results.
